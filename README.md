# Time-Series Forecasting
## Load & explore Time-Series data:
* How to load your time series dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
* How to peek at the loaded data and query using date-times.
* How to calculate and review summary statistics.

## Basic Feature Engineering:

## Data visualization:
## Resampling & Interpolation:
## Power transforms:
## Moving Average Smoothing
## Introduction to White Noise
* White noise time series is defined by a zero mean, constant variance, and zero correlation, 
* If your time series is white noise, it cannot be predicted, and if your forecast residuals are not white noise, you may be able to improve your model.
## Introduction to the Random Walk
* Random Walk and Autocorrelation.
* Random Walk and Stationarity.
## Decompose Time Series Data: 
* y(t) = Level + Trend + Seasonality + Noise, y(t) = Level * Trend * Seasonality * Noise
## Use and Remove Trends
* The importance and types of trends that may exist in time series and how to identify them.
* How to use a simple differencing method to remove a trend.
* How to model a linear trend and remove it from a sales time series dataset.
